# About
### A GRAPH THEORY PROJECT
A Graph Theory project that demonstrates my knowledge and skills using math & logic to solve real world problems. The chosen problem being that Rubik's cubes are often solved in the shortest amount of time, not the least amount of moves. This Python script first generates a Cayley Graph then uses distance classes and a Breadth-first search algorithms to find the shortest path between any scrambled cube and the solved state. First, the cube is encoded in *Python*, the problem is translated to mathematical language, then finally functions handle the large amount of data in a clever yet sophisticated way to solve the problem.

Please see my report for more details.

# Usage
### GUIDE TO USING READY-MADE CUBES
CopyPaste one of the encoded cubes below into the *'instance'* variable in *main.py* to solve using the program.

```python
"WSDAWKLDM33ML3MDSLKCMDLE"  # x  illegal cube
"WWWWGGGGRRRRBBBBOOOOYYYY"  # 0  steps - already solved
"WWBBGWGWRRRRYBYBOOOOGGYY"  # 1  step
"wwbbgwgwrrrrybyBOOOOGGYY"  # 1  step again (case-insensitive)
"WWROGGOWYWRGBRYRBOBBGOYY"  # 6  steps
"WYYYGGOBOORYBRRWGORWWBBG"  # 9  steps
"WRYGGGOBOYRYRWBRGOBWWOBY"  # 10 steps - harder cube, only found after generating half a million permutations
```
```python
instance = "WWROGGOWYWRGBRYRBOBBGOYY"
```

### GUIDE TO USING YOUR OWN CUBES
Rubik's Pocket Cube has 6 faces and 24 stickers (4 per face). When solved each face is a single colour, the colours are...

![colours](/img/colours.png)

Choose any face from your cube and draw a diagram out like this:

```
        ┌───┬───┐
        │ 1 │ 2 │
        ├───┼───┤
        │ 3 │ 4 │
┌───┬───┼───┼───┼───┬───┬───┬───┐
│ 5 │ 6 │ 9 │10 │ 13│14 │ 17│18 │
├───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┼───┤
│ 7 │ 8 │ 11│12 │ 15│16 │ 19│20 │
└───┴───┼───┼───┼───┴───┴───┴───┘
        │ 21│22 │
        ├───┼───┤
        │ 23│24 │
        └───┴───┘
```

Finally, follow the order in the diagram and note down the colour of the 24 stickers and you should end up with something like this:

```python
"WYYYGGOBOORYBRRWGORWWBBG"
```
### GUIDE TO USING DOCSTRINGS
CopyPaste the following commands into *main.py* to get details on what each function does.

```python
print("SOLUTION:" + project.solution.__doc__)
print("PRINT SOLUTION:" + project.printSolution.__doc__)
print("BREADTH-FIRST SEARCH:" + project.breadthFirst.__doc__)
```

# How to run via the Terminal
- Launch your OS' terminal.
- Navigate to the project folder (*cube-solver*) with the 'cd' command.
- Confirm you are in the project folder with the 'ls' command, you should see *main.py* among the files.

```zsh
foo@bar:~$ ls
README.md    bfs.py    main.py    ...
```

- Type 'python3 main.py' to launch the program.

```zsh
foo@bar:~$ python3 main.py
```

# How to run via *Visual Studio Code*
- Download *VScode*: https://code.visualstudio.com
- Follow the *Getting Started with Python* guide: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial
- Launch *VScode*.
- Select *Python* Interpreter version 2.7 or 3.8 or 3.9.
- Open the project folder (*disney-project*) in *VScode*.
- Select *main.py* and click run.
